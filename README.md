# Student-dataset
In this analysis, I explored various aspects of the 'student' data. Here's a summary of the analyses conducted:

### Descriptive Statistics:
+ Basic data inspection try to familiarise with the data
+ Calculated the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for 'math_score', 'reading_score', and 'writing_score'.
  
### Data Visualization:
+ Created bar plots to visualize the distribution of 'ethnicity', 'parental_education', and 'test_preparation_course'.
+ Plotted histograms to examine the distributions of 'math_score', 'reading_score', and 'writing_score'.
+ Utilized scatter plots to understand the relationship between 'reading_score' and 'writing_score' and explore it based on 'gender' and 'test_preparation_course'.
+ Employed box plots to observe the distribution of 'math_score' based on 'ethnicity' and 'lunch'.
+ Utilized violin plots to analyze 'math_score' distribution based on 'ethnicity' and 'gender' and many more.

### Correlation Analysis:
+ Calculated the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between 'math_score', 'reading_score', and 'writing_score'.
+ Plotted a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
+ Remove outliers
+ No missing values were detected

### Machine Learning Tasks:
+ Conducted predictive modeling using linear and logistics regression
